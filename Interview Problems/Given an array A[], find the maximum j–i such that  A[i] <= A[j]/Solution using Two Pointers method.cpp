	###  Given an array A[], find the maximum jâ€“i such that  A[i] <= A[j] ###

Task :  Given an array A[] of N positive integers. The task is to find the maximum 
of j-i subjected to the constraint of A[i] <= A[j].

Problem Link :  https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-index/0

Examples :

  Input: {34, 8, 10, 3, 2, 80, 30, 33, 1}
  Output: 6  (j = 7, i = 1)

  Input: {9, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 18, 0}
  Output: 8 ( j = 8, i = 0)

  Input:  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  Output: 5  (j = 5, i = 0)

  Input:  {6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
  Output: -1

Below Solution is based on two pointers method. I wrote this below solution by 
myself. And it is getting accepted in 0.18sec.

I think the Time Complexity of below solution is O(n) because in the comments, author of this 
problem said that the time limit for this question is set to an upper bound of O(n).
