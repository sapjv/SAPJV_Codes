         ### string find in C++  ###
         
String find is used to find the first occurrence of sub-string in the 
specified string being called upon. It returns the index of the first 
occurrence of the substring in the string from given starting position. 
The default value of starting position is 0.

Function Template:
size_t find (const string& str, size_t pos = 0);
size_t find (const char* s, size_t pos = 0);

Function parameters:
str : The sub-string to be searched.
s : The sub-string to be searched, given as C style string.
pos : The initial position from where the string search is to begin.

Function Return: The function returns the index of the first occurrence 
of sub-string, if the sub-string is not found it returns string::npos(string::pos 
is static member with value as the highest possible for the size_t data structure).

------------------------------

Note for size_t :  size_t is an unsigned integral data type. Also, we can convert size_t to int too. 

Itâ€™s a type which is used to represent the size of objects in bytes and is therefore used as the return 
type by the sizeof operator. It is guaranteed to be big enough to contain the size of the biggest object 
the host system can handle. Basically the maximum permissible size is dependent on the compiler; if the 
compiler is 32 bit then it is simply a typedef(i.e., alias) for unsigned int but if the compiler is 64 bit 
then it would be a typedef for unsigned long long. The size_t data type is never negative.

size_t or any unsigned type might be seen used as loop variable as loop variables are typically greater than 
or equal to 0.

Note: When we use a size_t object, we have to make sure that in all the contexts it is used, including 
arithmetic, we want only non-negative values. For instance, the following program would definitely give 
the unexpected result:

Output :
